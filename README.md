An example of how to run BDD testing with automation using Selenium WebDriver and PractiTest.   This example is showing .Net C#. 
This example was created for a demonstration film that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBntAx7-Jzs). 

To generate full visibility of your automated test results as a part of PractiTest project we recommend watching the entire film. 

Pre-required steps: 
1. Get an authentication token from PractiTest (Read about PractiTest API tokens [here](https://www.practitest.com/help/account/account-api-tokens/)
2. Get the Project ID (from Project Settings) and Author ID  

The workflow is showing how to record your Selenium #c results, using Rest API to complete the following steps: 
1. Create Test from API as explained here,   
2. Create Test Set from API as explained here
3. Associate Test & Test Set from API to Create Test Instance as explained here
